### HiðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Oleg, and I'm data engineer.  

My journey stated when I've decided to make a drastic change in my line of work. At the time I was working as an administrator and took a python development course for a year. Here I got the basics of python, DRF, databases, SQL, working with APIs, devops practices, docker, learned how to work with command line and Git.  

It took me deeper into the world of IT. I got interested in data and everything related to it. And now I'm so gladful and exited that Data Engineering combines everything I need: working with data and writing code!
